	"Name" : "Celtic Tribes",
	"Code" : "celt",
	"History" : "At its peak (around 200 B.C.), the massive Celtic Empire spanned from Spain to Romania and Northern Italy to Scotland; although it wasn't a true empire because the Celtic people were not united by any form of government, but only in language and various social aspects. Their lack of any cohesion was probably the largest contributing factor to their ultimate submission to Rome by 100 A.D. The other contributing factors were their lack of armor and their inability to counter the mighty legions and siege weapons of Rome."
